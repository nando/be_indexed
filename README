== BeIndexed matcher

  BeIndexed matcher is a custom RSpec matcher for RubyOnRails Ultrasphinx 
indexation plugin.

  Currently only :field and :delta options are supported by the matcher.

  Spec examples:
    MyModel.should be_indexed
    MyModel.should be_indexed.using_fields([:column1, :column2])
    MyModel.should be_indexed.with_delta
    MyModel.should be_indexed.with_delta(:field => 'last_modified') 
    MyModel.should be_indexed.using_fields(:column1).with_delta

  To used it you need to place the code at vendor/plugins and include 
Spec::Ultrasphinx::Matchers the matcher in your specs.

  To include the matcher so it can be used in all your specs you can do the
following in your spec_helper.rb:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include Spec::Ultrasphinx::Matchers
  end
